"Cancer Classification" contains several code cells and outputs, focused on building and evaluating a model for cancer classification. Here's a summary of its content:
Data Preprocessing and Setup:
It starts with loading and preprocessing the dataset, which likely involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, normalizing or standardizing the features, and encoding labels.
Model Building:
A machine learning model is constructed, probably using a neural network or a deep learning model like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a simple feedforward network. The model's architecture, including layers, activation functions, and possibly regularization methods, is defined.
Training the Model:
The model is trained using the training dataset. The process includes defining the loss function, optimizer, and metrics. The output shows training progress, including loss and accuracy metrics across epochs.
Model Evaluation:
The notebook contains evaluation code that tests the model's performance on unseen data (test set). Key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are likely calculated, and confusion matrices are plotted to visualize classification performance.
Prediction and Results:
The model is used to make predictions on the test set, and the results are printed. This might include predicted labels, probabilities, and the comparison of these predictions with the actual labels.
Output Examples:
The notebook includes outputs such as accuracy metrics, predicted labels, and possibly some visualizations related to the model's performance.
